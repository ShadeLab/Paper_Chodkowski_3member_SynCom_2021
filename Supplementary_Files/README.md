Supplementary File 1: Pairwise PROTEST analyses comparing the reproducibility of exometabolome profiles across biological replicate time series. Coordinates of the first two PCoA axes were used to perform PROTEST analysis in vegan. 

Supplementary File 2: Identification of B. thailandensis bioactive exometabolites of interest through observation of mass spectrometry data. 

Supplementary File 3: Genes part of the interspecies network, their corresponding modules, and GO enrichment analysis of modules.

Supplementary File 4: GO enrichment analysis on genes with interspecies edges from network analysis. 

Supplementary File 5: Gene annotations for C. subtsugae and P. syringae that contained interspecies edges with B. thailandensis thailandamide and malleilactone biosynthetic genes, respectively.

Supplementary File 6: Protein alignment of the DNA starvation/stationary phase protein from C. subtsugae and the closest homolog in B. thailandensis.

Supplementary File 7: Protein alignment of the TonB-dependent siderophore receptor family protein from P. syringae and the closest homolog in B. thailandensis.
