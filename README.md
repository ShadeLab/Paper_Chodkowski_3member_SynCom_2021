## Abstract
Some environments (e.g. soils) impose a stationary phase lifestyle, where microbes experience long periods of non-growth because of nutrient inaccessibility or short periods of nutrient flux. However, microbes can produce a diverse array of exometabolites in stationary phase that can shape the response and behaviors of surrounding neighbors in a microbial community. Knowledge gaps remain regarding the role of interspecies interactions in microbial communities, specifically the influence of exometabolite-mediated interactions during stationary phase. We evaluated the consequences of exometabolite interactions over stationary phase among three environmental bacteria: Burkholderia thailandensis E264 (ATCC 700388), Chromobacterium violaceum ATCC 31532, and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (ATCC BAA-871). We grew each strain in monoculture and all coculture arrangements (3 pairwise cocultures and the 3-member community) in synthetic communities to investigate the responses (transcripts) and behaviors (exometabolites) of each member resulting from coculturing. We found that members’ transcriptional dynamics were altered due to coculturing. These alterations could be attributed to the production and response to bioactive exometabolites involved in competition strategies. B. thailandensis had the largest influence on other synthetic community members, as it responded to coculturing by upregulating biosynthetic gene clusters involved in the production of bioactive exometabolites. We also found that members’ outcomes in the 3-member community were not always a simple summation of pairwise outcomes. These results reflect the importance of understanding how the maintenance of competitive strategies over stationary phase may contribute to community member dynamics during long periods of non-growth. These results also imply that bacterial responses and behaviors in more complex communities may not always be the sum of individual effects.
